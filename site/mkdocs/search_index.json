Analysis modules are generally run following the completion of a\nscenario, or at break points during scenario development to\nevaluate performance. Run times vary according to the complexity of the modules, with some requiring a few minutes or more.\n\n\nThe flowchart below illustrates connections among the analysis modules, which include building energy use, water use, fiscal impacts, transportation, and public health. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and household cost metrics are components of building energy and transportation analysis. This guide briefly outlines the analysis module outputs and underlying methodologies.\n\n\nFor reference, the \nUrbanFootprint Technical Documentation\n offers a more detailed description of the analysis methodologies developed for version 1.0 of the model, though note that it does not reflect more recent advancements.

Depending on the model, this may take a few minutes. Mapped outcomes can then be viewed by selecting layers in the \u2018Analysis Results\u2019 section on the left side of the interface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding Energy Use\n\n\nUrbanFootprint models building energy use for all new and existing residential and commercial buildings. Scenarios vary in their building energy use profiles due to their building program, the location of new growth, and policy-based assumptions for improvements in energy efficiency. Costs and GHG emissions associated with energy use, in turn, vary according to policy-based price and emissions rate assumptions.\n\n\nSummary metrics include:\n\n\n\n\nTotal energy use\n\n\nResidential energy use\n\n\nCommercial energy use\n\n\nResidential energy use per dwelling unit\n\n\nCommercial energy use per employee\n\n\n\n\nModel Methodology\n\n\nWithin the model, energy use is determined by three types of variables: building characteristics, climate zone, and efficiency factors. Building characteristics and climate zone determine what baseline per-residential unit or per-commercial square foot factors (derived from survey data) are used to calculate energy use. Reductions are then applied to the resulting baseline estimates to reflect the implementation of energy efficiency and conservation policies into the future.\n\n\n\n\nBaseline Energy Use Factors\n\n\nBaseline energy use factors quantify electricity and natural gas demand per residential unit or commercial square foot by building type and climate zone. Building characteristics are tied to scenario composition, while climate zone is location-dependent. Residential factors vary by California Energy Commission (CEC) Title 24 climate zones, while the commercial factors vary by CEC Forecasting Climate Zones (FCZ).\n\n\n\n\nResidential baselines\n\n\nResidential units in are classified by type, including small- and large-lot single family, townhome, and multifamily. For California, UrbanFootprint uses factors based on California Energy Commission (CEC) 2009 Residential Appliance Saturation Survey (RASS) data. These factors represent base-year energy use, with future-year energy use estimated in terms of reductions from base year estimates.\n\n\nRASS data can be filtered by a range of geographic, building, and household characteristics. Per-unit baselines are estimated by summarizing the data by climate zone, building type, and square footage. For energy modeling purposes, UrbanFootprint classifies the single family detached types into two simple categories: small lot and large lot. The table below shows how the RASS building type and unit size categories are associated with the UrbanFootprint building types.\n\n\n\n\nCommercial baselines\n\n\nBaseline commercial energy use factors specify the amount of electricity and natural gas used annually per square foot for commercial buildings. In California, these rates are based on CEC 2006 Commercial End-Use Survey (CEUS) data, which provide energy intensities (EI) \u2013 energy use per square foot \u2013 by end use for 14 building types, classified by CEC Forecasting Climate Zone. UrbanFootprint uses total energy intensities to include all end uses surveyed. The table below shows the schema of the CEUS commercial energy use factors, populated with baseline electricity use. These factors are applied to the building square footage in each of these categories as estimated by UrbanFootprint.\n\n\n\n\nEnergy Efficiency Assumptions\n\n\nEnergy efficiency policies are a major determinant of building energy use. New buildings are expected to meet increasingly higher standards for new construction, while the population of existing buildings is expected to exhibit improved performance as a result of buildings being retrofitted or replaced. UrbanFootprint applies two types of energy use reduction factors to express these effects on the various populations of new and existing buildings: 1) \nnew construction efficiency\n, which is applied to reflect the implementation of higher efficiency standards and policies into the future; and 2) \nretrofit efficiency\n, which is applied to reflect energy savings due to building improvements made through retrofits and minor renovations.\n\n\nNew construction efficiency\n\n\nNew construction includes new buildings and wholesale replacement and major renovations. This includes buildings built on greenfield land, those constructed through infill or redevelopment, and those built as replacements of existing buildings \u2013 each of these categories are treated as new construction.  The \u201cnew construction efficiency\u201d factor can be set to reflect specific energy-saving policies for new construction, such as California\u2019s Title 24 building standards, as well as local green building codes. The factor is expressed as a set of horizon-year energy use reduction targets (e.g., for 2020, 2035, and 2050) from baseline energy use. Different sets of targets can be applied to test specific policies for residential and commercial energy use, and the electricity and natural gas components of each.\n\n\nBetween horizon-year targets, the reductions are assumed to deepen at a steady rate. Thus, a multifamily unit built in 2025 would use less energy per year than the same type of unit built in 2015 \u2013 a rate which persists thereafter. By default, growth is assumed to occur at a steady rate between horizon years \u2013 that is, an equal number of units are allocated to each year over a defined period, though assumptions about the pace of new growth can be varied.\n\n\nWithin UrbanFootprint, a spreadsheet-based module is used to project forward the effects of deepening reductions over time to an end-state year \u2013 or in other words, convert horizon-year reduction targets into effective end-state reductions. A policy for new construction efficiency that meets a 20% reduction by 2020, a 50% reduction by 2035, and an 80% reduction by 2050 rate, for example, can be represented by a 41% reduction applied to all homes constructed over the period 2010 to 2050.\n\n\nRetrofit efficiency\n\n\nEnergy use in the population of existing buildings can be expected to decline over time as a result of buildings being retrofitted to achieve greater energy performance. Similarly, energy use in the population of \u201cnew\u201d buildings (those built within the time span of a scenario) can be expected to be further reduced due to retrofits in years subsequent to their construction.  The number of homes, or amount of commercial floor space, that undergo retrofits is determined by a retrofit rate assumption, taken as a percentage of building stock in each year. (This retrofit rate is also used in building water use calculations.)\n\n\nThe model uses a \u201cretrofit efficiency\u201d factor to reflect the savings potentials for residential and commercial electricity and natural gas use. This factor is expressed in terms of horizon-year target reductions from baseline (the same way that the new construction efficiency factor is expressed). The resulting end-year reductions are applied to the numbers of new and existing buildings that are assumed to be retrofitted over time.\n\n\nPolicy basis for assumptions\n\n\nThe table below shows a framework of default building energy use assumptions for California that represent three distinct policy directions: business-as-usual (BAU) performance, adopted policy, and aspirational policy. End-state targets are linked to specific years. Energy use in interim years is calculated according to a straight-line trend between the targets. The target years shown are flexible; functionally, targets can be set to any year, provided assumptions can be found or developed for the select target year(s).\n\n\n\n\nBuilding Energy Emissions and Costs\n\n\nThe GHG emissions and costs of electricity and natural gas use are calculated, in turn, on the basis of assumed emissions rates and retail energy prices into the future. Emissions rates vary based on the energy portfolio, with assumptions subject to different policy futures. Energy price assumptions may be projected according to trends, or otherwise asserted.\n\n\nWater Use\n\n\nUrbanFootprint models residential and commercial water uses for all buildings in a base year and for future scenarios. Scenarios vary in their water use profiles due to their building program, the location of new growth, and policy-based assumptions about improvements in water efficiency over time. The costs and GHG emissions associated with water use, in turn, vary according to policy-based price and emissions rate assumptions.\n\n\nSummary metrics include:\n\n\n\n\nTotal annual water use\n\n\nAnnual residential water use, indoor and outdoor\n\n\nAnnual commercial water use, indoor and outdoor\n\n\n\n\nModel Methodology\n\n\nIndoor and outdoor water use for residential and commercial buildings is modeled separately within UrbanFootprint. Indoor water use is estimated on a per-capita basis, while outdoor water use is estimated on the basis of irrigated area at the parcel scale.  Indoor and outdoor water use is first calculated according to baseline rates and then adjusted to account for the application of efficiency and conservation policies into the future.\n\n\nBaseline Water Use Factors\n\n\nBaseline water use factors quantify residential indoor water use per capita by building type, commercial indoor water use per capita by employment category, and outdoor water use per irrigated square foot by evapotranspiration zone. Building types are tied to scenario composition, while evapotranspiration zone is location-dependent.\n\n\nIndoor baselines\n\n\nIndoor water use varies according to household size and building type, with multifamily homes generally requiring slightly less water per capita than single family homes. Baseline indoor water use factors are expressed in terms of gallons per capita per day (gpcd). Indoor usage patterns generally do not vary significantly by climate or location (if the same building/fixture standards are in place), though indoor factors can be calibrated to regional or local data where available.\n\n\nIndoor water use for commercial uses is estimated on a per-employee basis. This approach is based on existing research and data that estimates commercial and institutional water use in terms of gallons per employee per day (GED) by employment sector. These factors were derived from a combination of modeled and survey data, taking into account general water uses, such as building cooling and restroom use, as well as water uses that relate to specific employment sectors, such as food service or medical care. Because UrbanFootprint models outdoor water use separately from indoor water use, the landscape irrigation component of per-employee water use rates is excluded.\n\n\nThe model uses baseline per-employee indoor water use factors for three general categories: retail, office, and industrial. These factors represent average use across all North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) subsectors within each commercial category. The rates are applied to the numbers of jobs by category in each scenario, which is determined by base year data and allocations of future employment as specified by place and building types.\n\n\nOutdoor baselines\n\n\nOutdoor water use for residential and commercial buildings is calculated based on assumptions about amount of irrigated area, and per-acre watering needs based on climate. The irrigated acreage per residential unit, or per acre of a commercial building type, is estimated using lot size, impervious cover, and irrigated land percentage assumptions.\n\n\nPer-acre landscape irrigation requirements are derived from reference evapotranspiration (ETo) values. Evapotranspiration values, which measure plant water loss to the atmosphere, vary according to climate. The California Department of Water Resources provides monthly and yearly average ETo values for 18 zones in the state, as shown in the figure below. These values, expressed in inches of water, are used to determine per-acre outdoor water demand per month or year. An evapotranspiration adjustment factor is applied as a multiplier to evapotranspiration values to reflect assumptions about plant types and irrigation efficiency. This method for estimating outdoor water demand is detailed by the California Department of Water Resources\u2019 Model Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance. UrbanFootprint uses annual ETo values.\n\n\n\n\nWater Efficiency Assumptions\n\n\nWater efficiency policies are a major determinant of building energy use. New buildings are expected to meet increasingly higher standards for new construction, while the population of existing buildings is expected to exhibit improved performance as a result of buildings being retrofitted or replaced. Similar to the application of energy efficiency assumptions, UrbanFootprint applies two types of water use reduction factors to express the effects of policies for new and existing buildings: 1) \nnew construction efficiency\n, which is applied to reflect the implementation of higher efficiency standards and policies into the future; and 2) \nretrofit efficiency\n, which is applied to reflect water savings due to building improvements.\n\n\nNew construction efficiency\n\n\nNew construction includes new buildings and wholesale replacement and major renovations. This includes buildings built on greenfield land, those constructed through infill or redevelopment, and those built as replacements of existing buildings \u2013 each of these categories are treated as new construction.  The \u201cnew construction efficiency\u201d factor can be set to reflect specific water-saving policies for new construction. The factor is expressed as a set of horizon-year water use reduction targets (e.g., for 2020, 2035, and 2050) from baseline water use. Different sets of targets can be applied to test specific policies for residential and commercial water use, and the indoor and outdoor components of each.\n\n\nBetween horizon-year targets, the reductions are assumed to deepen at a steady rate. Thus, a multifamily unit built in 2025 would use less water per year than the same type of unit built in 2015 \u2013 a rate which persists thereafter. By default, growth is assumed to occur at a steady rate between horizon years \u2013 that is, an equal number of units are allocated to each year over a defined period, though assumptions about the pace of new growth can be varied.\n\n\nWithin UrbanFootprint, a spreadsheet-based module is used to project forward the effects of deepening reductions over time to an end-state year \u2013 or in other words, convert horizon-year reduction targets into effective end-state reductions. A policy for new construction efficiency that meets a 20% reduction by 2020, a 50% reduction by 2035, and an 80% reduction by 2050 rate, for example, can be represented by a 41% reduction applied to all homes constructed over the period 2010 to 2050.\n\n\nRetrofit efficiency\n\n\nWater use in the population of existing buildings can be expected to decline over time as a result of buildings being retrofitted with new systems, fixtures, and irrigation technologies. Similarly, water use in the population of \u201cnew\u201d buildings (those built within the time span of a scenario) can be expected to be further reduced due to retrofits in the years subsequent to their construction.  The number of homes, or commercial buildings, that undergo retrofits are determined by a retrofit rate assumption, taken as a percentage of building stock in each year. (This retrofit rate is also used in building energy use calculations.)\n\n\nThe model uses a \u201cretrofit efficiency\u201d factor to reflect the savings potentials for residential and commercial indoor and outdoor water use. This factor is expressed in terms of horizon-year target reductions from baseline (in the same way that the new construction efficiency factor is expressed). The resulting end-year reductions are applied to the numbers of new and existing buildings that are assumed to be retrofitted over time.\n\n\nTo account for water use reductions resulting from continued minor improvements and conservation behaviors, the model applies an additional Upgrade Efficiency factor to all buildings. A percentage reduction is applied as an annual reduction from the annual energy use total of the replacement units of the base. Over time, a rate of 0.25% would compound such that units can achieve a maximum of about 11% in additional water savings to 2050.\n\n\nPolicy basis for assumptions\n\n\nThe table below shows a proposed framework of default water efficiency assumptions for California that represent three distinct policy directions: business-as-usual (BAU) performance, adopted policy, and aspirational policy. End-state targets are linked to specific years. Water use in interim years is calculated according to a straight-line trend between the targets.\n\n\n\n\nWater Costs\n\n\nThe costs of water use are calculated, in turn, on the basis of assumed retail water prices into the future. Price assumptions may be projected according to trends, or otherwise asserted.\n\n\nLocal Fiscal Impacts\n\n\nFiscal impact analysis allows users to compare the implications of varying forms of development on local expenditures and revenues. The UrbanFootprint 1.5 version of the model focuses on the impacts associated with new residential growth, accounting for the capital costs of new and upgraded local infrastructure; local operations and maintenance (O&M) costs to serve new and upgraded infrastructure; and major sources of city revenues.\n\n\n\n\nModel Methodology\n\n\nFiscal impacts are calculated on the basis of per-housing unit and per-capita cost and revenue factors that vary by UrbanFootprint land development category (LDC: Urban, Compact, or Standard, as described below), refill or greenfield development condition, and housing type (single family detached large lot, single family detached small lot, single family attached or multifamily). The factors, originally developed by Strategic Economics and Calthorpe Analytics to estimate the fiscal impacts of statewide scenarios, are based on development impact fees, local general fund expenditures, housing market data, and other empirical data for representative places throughout California.\n\n\nInfrastructure costs\n\n\nOne-time capital costs for local infrastructure are estimated on the basis of per-housing unit cost factors. The assumed factors are comprised of three component costs: streets and transportation, water supply, and sewage and wastewater.  The component costs can be added together to produce a per-unit total infrastructure cost by housing type and land development category. Assumptions for the Compact land development category also vary by development condition since the per-unit average costs associated with refill (infill or redevelopment) and greenfield development differ. Costs are assumed to remain constant over time.\n\n\nOperations and maintenance (O&M) costs\n\n\nOngoing annual operations and maintenance (O&M) cost assumptions for local infrastructure focus on local spending related to engineering and public works functions.  These component costs produce a per-unit total O&M cost by housing unit type and land development category. Assumptions for the Compact land development category also vary by development condition since the per-unit average costs associated with refill and greenfield development differ. If desired, the component assumptions can be used to model costs for individual categories \u2013 for example, O&M costs for public works or engineering functions alone.\n\n\nLocal revenues\n\n\nOngoing annual local revenue assumptions include projected revenues from property taxes, property transfer taxes, and vehicle license fees. The per-unit assumptions vary by housing type and land development category. Assumptions for the Compact land development category also vary by development condition since the per-unit average costs associated with refill and greenfield development differ.\n\n\nLand Development Categories\n\n\nUrbanFootprint\u2019s fiscal impacts analysis module is sensitive to cost and revenue variations among three Land Development Categories, and refill or greenfield development conditions. The LDCs \u2013 Urban, Compact, and Standard \u2013 represent distinct forms of land use, ranging from dense and walkable mixed-use urban areas well served by transit, to lower-intensity, less walkable places where land uses are segregated and most trips are made via automobile. Each UrbanFootprint place type fits into a single LDC.\n\n\nThe distinct forms of growth represented by the LDCs result in differences in fiscal performance.\n\n\nThe \nUrban\n LDC represents the most intense and most mixed of the Land Development Categories, which in most cases would be found within and directly adjacent to moderate and high density urban centers. Virtually all of the development that falls into the Urban LDC would be considered infill or redevelopment. The majority of housing in Urban areas tends to be multifamily and attached single family (townhome), with some small-lot single family homes.\n\n\nThe \nCompact\n LDC is less intense than the Urban category, but is nonetheless highly walkable and contains a rich mix of retail, commercial, residential, and civic uses. The Compact form is most likely to occur as new growth on the urban edge or as larger scale (ground-up) redevelopment within urban areas. Compact areas contain a rich mix of housing, from multifamily and attached single family (townhome) to small- and medium-lot single family homes.\n\n\nThe \nStandard\n LDC represents the majority of separate-use auto-oriented development that has dominated the American suburban landscape over the past five to six decades. Densities tend to be lower than that of the Compact LDC, and are generally not highly mixed or organized in ways that facilitate walking, biking, or transit service. While Standard can contain a wide variety of housing types, including attached and multifamily units, medium- and larger-lot single family homes tend to comprise the majority of this development form.\n\n\nTransportation\n\n\nUrbanFootprint incorporates a comprehensive \u201dsketch\u201d travel model that interacts with regional travel network data to produce estimates of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) for land use + transportation scenarios. In turn, the VMT estimates are used to calculate transportation-related costs, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and pollutant emissions. The core of UrbanFootprint\u2019s travel engine was adapted from the Mixed-Use Trip Generation (MXD) model developed by Fehr & Peers for the US EPA.\n\n\nSummary metrics include:\n\n\n\n\nTotal VMT\n\n\nVMT per household\n\n\nVMT per capita\n\n\nVMT per employee\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Methodology\n\n\nThe UrbanFootprint travel model uses the findings from California and nationwide MXD research to quantify the transportation effects of differences in transportation and development form ranging from highly sustainable compact, mixed and transit-oriented forms to land use patterns that are more auto-dependent. This relies upon measurement of each of the following \u20188Ds\u2019 for each micro-scale development area.\n\n\n\n\nDensity -- Dwellings and jobs per acre of development.\n\n\nDiversity -- Mix of housing, jobs and retail, measured in terms of ratios such as jobs/housing, retail/housing and jobs mix (closeness to a balance among uses).\n\n\nDesign -- Connectivity and walkability, measured in terms of how fine-grained the circulation networks through metrics of network density, such as walkable street intersections per square mile.\n\n\nDestinations -- Regional accessibility to activities from the regional travel model networks \u201cskim matrices\u201d of travel distances and travel times among all development areas or travel analysis zones (TAZs).\n\n\nDistance to Transit -- Proximity to fixed-guideway service measured from the UrbanFootprint development grid cell to the nearest transit stops, and expressed in terms of transit stops within walking radii of \u00bc and \u00bd mile.\n\n\nDevelopment Scale -- Absolute local amounts of population and jobs within the development grid cell\u2019s neighborhood (critical mass and magnitude of compatible uses), measured in terms of a \u00bd mile walking radius.\n\n\nDemographics -- Household size, income and auto ownership of the residential development types contained in the development area.\n\n\nDemand Management \u2013 Automobile travel disincentives, including regional pricing of auto travel through fuel costs, mileage-based fees and taxes and parking charges. (This method has been developed, but is not implemented in UrbanFootprint 1.5.)\n\n\n\n\nUrbanFootprint quantifies the relationships to the first seven \u201cDs\u201d through a series of equations from a rigorous statistical study (Traffic Generated by Mixed-Use Developments\u2014Six-Region Study Using Consistent Built Environmental Measures, prepared for the US EPA and reviewed by the American Society of Civil Engineers) that developed hierarchical models that capture the relationships between the \u201cD\u201d factors and the amount of travel generated by over 230 mixed-use developments of a wide variety of settings and sizes across the US, including the Sacramento and San Diego regions. The predictive accuracy of the methods were validated through field surveys of traffic at almost 30 other development sites, more than half of which are located in California, at locations in San Diego, Orange County, Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\n\nThe resulting method, known as the MXD method, uses a series of equations to estimate the likely degree to which a development area\u2019s external traffic generation will be reduced due to development density, diversity, design, destination accessibility, distance to transit, demographics and development scale. UrbanFootprint uses the MXD method and other California research on the effects of various Demand Management strategies as its \u20188D\u2019 travel engine.\n\n\nUrbanFootprint combines the MXD estimates of trip generation by travel mode with regional information on transportation networks and travel distances among activities to compute measures of accessibility and vehicle miles traveled (VMT). For consistency with regional transportation policy and programs, UrbanFootprint draws this network information from regional travel models, reflecting (in California) the regions' Sustainable Communities Strategies (SCSs) and modal emphasis alternatives from their Regional Transportation Plans (RTPs).\n\n\nUrbanFootprint inputs\n\n\nThe inputs to the travel model are summarized below.\n\n\nLand Use\n (based on a half-mile buffer around each location):\n\n\n\n\nPopulation\n\n\nEmployment\n\n\nDwelling units by type\n\n\nSquare feet of non-residential use by category: office, retail, service,\n    public\n\n\n\n\nUrban Form\n (based on a half mile buffer around each location):\n\n\n\n\nIntersection density\n\n\nHousehold size\n\n\nAuto ownership\n\n\n\n\nLocation and Context\n\n\n\n\nEmployment within a one-mile radius\n\n\nJobs within 30 minutes by transit\n\n\n\n\nModel outputs\n\n\nThe transportation model results can be summarized and mapped to compare impacts across scenarios. The map below, for example, shows projected VMT per household in the Sacramento area, modeled as part of the Vision California project by Calthorpe Associates (now Calthorpe Analytics). The charts that follow summarize the differences in projected VMT between two alternate land use scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransportation costs and emissions\n\n\nCosts and emissions estimates can be calculated, in turn, by applying input assumptions that vary according to projected policy and technological pathways. Inputs include fuel price; auto ownership and maintenance costs; vehicle fleet mix, fuel economy, and rates of pollutant emissions; and the carbon intensity of fuels and electricity.\n\n\nPublic Health\n\n\nUrbanFootprint estimates the impact of land use patterns and urban form on a range of health-related indicators. The public health metrics are derived from factors that are influenced by changes in urban form, including physical activity-related weight and disease incidences. Related costs can be estimated in turn to highlight the fiscal implications of comparative land use and transportation scenarios.\n\n\nThe public health module uses regression models built by Urban Design 4 Health (UD4H) that are grounded in primary research and travel and health survey data from California and throughout the country. The model uses demographic inputs and variables representing the built environment to forecast the amount of time spent in moderate and vigorous activity, proportion of the population that is overweight, and time spent in cars. These are then used to identify the incidence of weight and activity-related diseases and resulting costs.\n\n\n\n\nModel Methodology\n\n\nThe form of the built environment influences physical activity \u2013 for instance, residents of a compact, mixed-use neighborhood are more likely to walk as a part of their regular routine, whereas residents of a low-density residential suburb are likely to spend more time in cars. UrbanFootprint measures the characteristics of urban form that have a demonstrated link to physical activity levels; these are processed into a form useable by the public health module as a set of pre-processes. The pre-processes used to measure the relevant aspects of urban form include:\n\n\n\n\nThe walkability index\n\n\nThe building use mix measurement\n\n\nThe dwelling unit density measurement\n\n\nA network-based walkable street intersection count and density measurement\n\n\n\n\nThe public health engine models five primary weight and physical activity metrics for the adult population:\n\n\n\n\nMinutes per day of moderate and vigorous physical activity (MVPA)\n\n\nDaily time spent in cars\n\n\nPercent of the adult population that is overweight and obese\n\n\nPercent of the adult population that is obese\n\n\nAverage BMI (body mass index)\n\n\n\n\nThe amount of physical activity influences the amount of calories burned, which influences body weight, which in turn influences certain health outcomes such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Physical activity is measured using average daily minutes of moderate and vigorous physical activity (MVPA) as well as adult daily time spent in cars; body weight is measured by average body mass index and the percent of the adult population that is overweight and obese; related health outcomes are measured as a separate step.\n\n\nIn this version (1.5) of UrbanFootprint\u2019s health module, MVPA and average car time are not directly used as inputs to any models of health outcomes; rather, they are produced as indicators of the effects of urban form on physical activity levels. The health outcomes that depict the effects of the level of physical activity all flow from the models predicting adult overweight and obese percentages.\n\n\nUrbanFootprint inputs and model outputs\n\n\nUrbanFootprint scenarios are built upon a highly detailed \u201ccanvas\u201d of data that constitutes a baseline assessment of existing land use, demographic characteristics, and other conditions, providing the context for scenario painting and the foundation for analysis. In building future scenarios, users assert changes to population and employment distributions and built form characteristics upon this base canvas of data.\n\n\nThe UrbanFootprint inputs to the public health model include:\n\n\n\n\nTotal population\n\n\nTotal households\n\n\nTotal employees\n\n\nGross population density\n\n\nGross employment density\n\n\nEmployment entropy index\n\n\nRetail employment\n\n\nStreet intersection density\n\n\nNatural land cover variables\n\n\nJobs within 45 minute transit commute\n\n\nProportion of employment with \u00bc mile of fixed guideway transit stop\n\n\nTrip production/attraction equilibrium\n\n\nPercent of households with zero vehicles\n\n\n\n\nActivity and health related outputs include:\n\n\n\n\nProportion of people walking (at all) for transportation on any given day (travel survey model)\n\n\nCumulative daily duration (in minutes) of walking for transportation (travel survey model)\n\n\nProportion of people walking (at all) for transportation on any given week (health survey model)\n\n\nCumulative weekly duration (in minutes) of walking for transportation (health survey model)\n\n\nProportion of people walking (at all) for leisure on any given week (health survey model)\n\n\nCumulative weekly duration (in minutes) of walking for leisure on any given week (health survey model)\n\n\nProportion of people walking (at all) for transportation or leisure on any given week (health survey model)\n\n\nCumulative weekly duration (in minutes) of walking for transportation or leisure on any given week (health survey model)\n\n\nProportion of people biking (at all) for transportation on any given day (travel survey model)\n\n\nCumulative daily duration (in minutes) of biking for transportation  (travel survey model)\n\n\nProportion of people engaging in recreational physical activity (at all) on any given day (travel survey model)\n\n\nCumulative daily duration (in minutes) of recreational physical activity (travel survey model)\n\n\nProportion of people taking a trip by auto (at all) on any given day (travel survey model)\n\n\nCumulative daily duration (in minutes) of time spent in an auto (sedentary time) (travel survey model)\n\n\nAverage BMI of CBG population (health survey model)\n\n\nProportion of CBG population that is overweight or obese (BMI 25+) (health survey model)\n\n\nProportion of CBG population that is obese (BMI 30+)  (health survey model)\n\n\nProportion of CBG population with a K6 mental health score indicating moderate or serious psychological distress  (health survey model)\n\n\nProportion of CBG population with self-reported poor general health (health survey model)\n\n\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nThe following reports, prepared by Urban Design 4 Health (UD4H) and Calthorpe Analytics as part of a 2015 technical review process led by California state and regional agencies, provide detailed information about the public health model and its development:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia Public Health Assessment Model (C-PHAM): Methods, Data, and UrbanFootprint Application\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia Public Health Assessment Model: Final Data Development and Model Results",

RASS data can be filtered by a range of geographic, building, and household characteristics. Per-unit baselines are estimated by summarizing the data by climate zone, building type, and square footage.

            "text": "Energy efficiency policies are a major determinant of building energy use. New buildings are expected to meet increasingly higher standards for new construction, while the population of existing buildings is expected to exhibit improved performance as a result of buildings being retrofitted or replaced. UrbanFootprint applies two types of energy use reduction factors to express these effects on the various populations of new and existing buildings: 1)  new construction efficiency , which is applied to reflect the implementation of higher efficiency standards and policies into the future; and 2)  retrofit efficiency , which is applied to reflect energy savings due to building improvements made through retrofits and minor renovations.  New construction efficiency  New construction includes new buildings and wholesale replacement and major renovations. This includes buildings built on greenfield land, those constructed through infill or redevelopment, and those built as replacements of existing buildings \u2013 each of these categories are treated as new construction.  The \u201cnew construction efficiency\u201d factor can be set to reflect specific energy-saving policies for new construction, such as California\u2019s Title 24 building standards, as well as local green building codes. The factor is expressed as a set of horizon-year energy use reduction targets (e.g., for 2020, 2035, and 2050) from baseline energy use. Different sets of targets can be applied to test specific policies for residential and commercial energy use, and the electricity and natural gas components of each.  Between horizon-year targets, the reductions are assumed to deepen at a steady rate. Thus, a multifamily unit built in 2025 would use less energy per year than the same type of unit built in 2015 \u2013 a rate which persists thereafter. By default, growth is assumed to occur at a steady rate between horizon years \u2013 that is, an equal number of units are allocated to each year over a defined period, though assumptions about the pace of new growth can be varied.  Within UrbanFootprint, a spreadsheet-based module is used to project forward the effects of deepening reductions over time to an end-state year \u2013 or in other words, convert horizon-year reduction targets into effective end-state reductions. A policy for new construction efficiency that meets a 20% reduction by 2020, a 50% reduction by 2035, and an 80% reduction by 2050 rate, for example, can be represented by a 41% reduction applied to all homes constructed over the period 2010 to 2050.  Retrofit efficiency  Energy use in the population of existing buildings can be expected to decline over time as a result of buildings being retrofitted to achieve greater energy performance. Similarly, energy use in the population of \u201cnew\u201d buildings (those built within the time span of a scenario) can be expected to be further reduced due to retrofits in years subsequent to their construction.  The number of homes, or amount of commercial floor space, that undergo retrofits is determined by a retrofit rate assumption, taken as a percentage of building stock in each year. (This retrofit rate is also used in building water use calculations.)  The model uses a \u201cretrofit efficiency\u201d factor to reflect the savings potentials for residential and commercial electricity and natural gas use. This factor is expressed in terms of horizon-year target reductions from baseline (the same way that the new construction efficiency factor is expressed). The resulting end-year reductions are applied to the numbers of new and existing buildings that are assumed to be retrofitted over time.

Building types are tied to scenario composition, while evapotranspiration zone is location-dependent.  Indoor baselines  Indoor water use varies according to household size and building type, with multifamily homes generally requiring slightly less water per capita than single family homes. Baseline indoor water use factors are expressed in terms of gallons per capita per day (gpcd). Indoor usage patterns generally do not vary significantly by climate or location (if the same building/fixture standards are in place), though indoor factors can be calibrated to regional or local data where available.  Indoor water use for commercial uses is estimated on a per-employee basis. This approach is based on existing research and data that estimates commercial and institutional water use in terms of gallons per employee per day (GED) by employment sector. These factors were derived from a combination of modeled and survey data, taking into account general water uses, such as building cooling and restroom use, as well as water uses that relate to specific employment sectors, such as food service or medical care. Because UrbanFootprint models outdoor water use separately from indoor water use, the landscape irrigation component of per-employee water use rates is excluded.  The model uses baseline per-employee indoor water use factors for three general categories: retail, office, and industrial. These factors represent average use across all North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) subsectors within each commercial category. The rates are applied to the numbers of jobs by category in each scenario, which is determined by base year data and allocations of future employment as specified by place and building types.

The irrigated acreage per residential unit, or per acre of a commercial building type, is estimated using lot size, impervious cover, and irrigated land percentage assumptions.  Per-acre landscape irrigation requirements are derived from reference evapotranspiration (ETo) values. Evapotranspiration values, which measure plant water loss to the atmosphere, vary according to climate. The California Department of Water Resources provides monthly and yearly average ETo values for 18 zones in the state, as shown in the figure below. These values, expressed in inches of water, are used to determine per-acre outdoor water demand per month or year. An evapotranspiration adjustment factor is applied as a multiplier to evapotranspiration values to reflect assumptions about plant types and irrigation efficiency. This method for estimating outdoor water demand is detailed by the California Department of Water Resources\u2019 Model Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance. UrbanFootprint uses annual ETo values.",

            "text": "Water efficiency policies are a major determinant of building energy use. New buildings are expected to meet increasingly higher standards for new construction, while the population of existing buildings is expected to exhibit improved performance as a result of buildings being retrofitted or replaced. Similar to the application of energy efficiency assumptions, UrbanFootprint applies two types of water use reduction factors to express the effects of policies for new and existing buildings: 1)  new construction efficiency , which is applied to reflect the implementation of higher efficiency standards and policies into the future; and 2)  retrofit efficiency , which is applied to reflect water savings due to building improvements.  New construction efficiency  New construction includes new buildings and wholesale replacement and major renovations. This includes buildings built on greenfield land, those constructed through infill or redevelopment, and those built as replacements of existing buildings \u2013 each of these categories are treated as new construction.  The \u201cnew construction efficiency\u201d factor can be set to reflect specific water-saving policies for new construction. The factor is expressed as a set of horizon-year water use reduction targets (e.g., for 2020, 2035, and 2050) from baseline water use. Different sets of targets can be applied to test specific policies for residential and commercial water use, and the indoor and outdoor components of each.  Between horizon-year targets, the reductions are assumed to deepen at a steady rate. Thus, a multifamily unit built in 2025 would use less water per year than the same type of unit built in 2015 \u2013 a rate which persists thereafter. By default, growth is assumed to occur at a steady rate between horizon years \u2013 that is, an equal number of units are allocated to each year over a defined period, though assumptions about the pace of new growth can be varied.  Within UrbanFootprint, a spreadsheet-based module is used to project forward the effects of deepening reductions over time to an end-state year \u2013 or in other words, convert horizon-year reduction targets into effective end-state reductions. A policy for new construction efficiency that meets a 20% reduction by 2020, a 50% reduction by 2035, and an 80% reduction by 2050 rate, for example, can be represented by a 41% reduction applied to all homes constructed over the period 2010 to 2050.  Retrofit efficiency  Water use in the population of existing buildings can be expected to decline over time as a result of buildings being retrofitted with new systems, fixtures, and irrigation technologies. Similarly, water use in the population of \u201cnew\u201d buildings (those built within the time span of a scenario) can be expected to be further reduced due to retrofits in the years subsequent to their construction.  The number of homes, or commercial buildings, that undergo retrofits are determined by a retrofit rate assumption, taken as a percentage of building stock in each year. (This retrofit rate is also used in building energy use calculations.)  The model uses a \u201cretrofit efficiency\u201d factor to reflect the savings potentials for residential and commercial indoor and outdoor water use. This factor is expressed in terms of horizon-year target reductions from baseline (in the same way that the new construction efficiency factor is expressed). The resulting end-year reductions are applied to the numbers of new and existing buildings that are assumed to be retrofitted over time.  To account for water use reductions resulting from continued minor improvements and conservation behaviors, the model applies an additional Upgrade Efficiency factor to all buildings. A percentage reduction is applied as an annual reduction from the annual energy use total of the replacement units of the base. Over time, a rate of 0.25% would compound such that units can achieve a maximum of about 11% in additional water savings to 2050.  Policy basis for assumptions  The table below shows a proposed framework of default water efficiency assumptions for California that represent three distinct policy directions: business-as-usual (BAU) performance, adopted policy, and aspirational policy. End-state targets are linked to specific years. Water use in interim years is calculated according to a straight-line trend between the targets.",

The factors, originally developed by Strategic Economics and Calthorpe Analytics to estimate the fiscal impacts of statewide scenarios, are based on development impact fees, local general fund expenditures, housing market data, and other empirical data for representative places throughout California.  Infrastructure costs  One-time capital costs for local infrastructure are estimated on the basis of per-housing unit cost factors. The assumed factors are comprised of three component costs: streets and transportation, water supply, and sewage and wastewater.  The component costs can be added together to produce a per-unit total infrastructure cost by housing type and land development category.

Costs are assumed to remain constant over time.

Each UrbanFootprint place type fits into a single LDC.  The distinct forms of growth represented by the LDCs result in differences in fiscal performance.  The  Urban  LDC represents the most intense and most mixed of the Land Development Categories, which in most cases would be found within and directly adjacent to moderate and high density urban centers. Virtually all of the development that falls into the Urban LDC would be considered infill or redevelopment. The majority of housing in Urban areas tends to be multifamily and attached single family (townhome), with some small-lot single family homes.  The  Compact  LDC is less intense than the Urban category, but is nonetheless highly walkable and contains a rich mix of retail, commercial, residential, and civic uses. The Compact form is most likely to occur as new growth on the urban edge or as larger scale (ground-up) redevelopment within urban areas. Compact areas contain a rich mix of housing, from multifamily and attached single family (townhome) to small- and medium-lot single family homes.  The  Standard  LDC represents the majority of separate-use auto-oriented development that has dominated the American suburban landscape over the past five to six decades. Densities tend to be lower than that of the Compact LDC, and are generally not highly mixed or organized in ways that facilitate walking, biking, or transit service. While Standard can contain a wide variety of housing types, including attached and multifamily units, medium- and larger-lot single family homes tend to comprise the majority of this development form.",

Diversity -- Mix of housing, jobs and retail, measured in terms of ratios such as jobs/housing, retail/housing and jobs mix (closeness to a balance among uses).  Design -- Connectivity and walkability, measured in terms of how fine-grained the circulation networks through metrics of network density, such as walkable street intersections per square mile.  Destinations -- Regional accessibility to activities from the regional travel model networks \u201cskim matrices\u201d of travel distances and travel times among all development areas or travel analysis zones (TAZs).  Distance to Transit -- Proximity to fixed-guideway service measured from the UrbanFootprint development grid cell to the nearest transit stops, and expressed in terms of transit stops within walking radii of \u00bc and \u00bd mile.  Development Scale -- Absolute local amounts of population and jobs within the development grid cell\u2019s neighborhood (critical mass and magnitude of compatible uses), measured in terms of a \u00bd mile walking radius.

Demand Management \u2013 Automobile travel disincentives, including regional pricing of auto travel through fuel costs, mileage-based fees and taxes and parking charges. (This method has been developed, but is not implemented in UrbanFootprint 1.5.)   UrbanFootprint quantifies the relationships to the first seven \u201cDs\u201d through a series of equations from a rigorous statistical study (Traffic Generated by Mixed-Use Developments\u2014Six-Region Study Using Consistent Built Environmental Measures, prepared for the US EPA and reviewed by the American Society of Civil Engineers) that developed hierarchical models that capture the relationships between the \u201cD\u201d factors and the amount of travel generated by over 230 mixed-use developments of a wide variety of settings and sizes across the US, including the Sacramento and San Diego regions. The predictive accuracy of the methods were validated through field surveys of traffic at almost 30 other development sites, more than half of which are located in California, at locations in San Diego, Orange County, Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay Area.  The resulting method, known as the MXD method, uses a series of equations to estimate the likely degree to which a development area\u2019s external traffic generation will be reduced due to development density, diversity, design, destination accessibility, distance to transit, demographics and development scale. UrbanFootprint uses the MXD method and other California research on the effects of various Demand Management strategies as its \u20188D\u2019 travel engine.  UrbanFootprint combines the MXD estimates of trip generation by travel mode with regional information on transportation networks and travel distances among activities to compute measures of accessibility and vehicle miles traveled (VMT). For consistency with regional transportation policy and programs, UrbanFootprint draws this network information from regional travel models, reflecting (in California) the regions' Sustainable Communities Strategies (SCSs) and modal emphasis alternatives from their Regional Transportation Plans (RTPs).",

The effort that goes into data collection, preparation, and review should not be underestimated.\n\n\nSample Data Set\n\n\nA sample dataset of Elk Grove, CA is available and is included in the \nREADME-developers.md\n\nand \nREADME-developers-windows.md\n\ninstructions in the \nUrbanFootprint\n repo.\n\n\nIf you would like to use your own data, please see the below.\n\n\nCreating a New Data Set\n\n\nThe base data which is also called the base canvas, or existing conditions dataset will require extensive data collection, processing, and then review prior to its use. The requirements imposed by UrbanFootprint on its base conditions data include strict adherence to the data schema, and the need for a detailed understanding of the existing conditions at a parcel level. If you are working in a geographic area that has not had a prior installation of UrbanFootprint, it is unlikely that there will be a dataset that you can use without substantial effort in createing a base condition dataset.\n\n\nScenario development has looser data requirements, but will require that you have an understanding of regional and local plans for the future, and have planned out goals for the scenario that can be translated onto a map at a parcel scale.\n\n\nEnvironmental constraint layers influence the intensity of development that is possible in locations where these constraints are present.\n\n\nReference layers provide a visual reference to UrbanFootprint users while editing or visualizing scenarios.\n\n\nThe transportation module (and any other modules that build on its results) will require that you have substantial additional data derived from both regional transportation infrastructure GIS as well as a travel demand model.\n\n\nSome of the other analytical modules also require climate data to run.\n\n\nData Types and Sources\n\n\nData for the Base Canvas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Type\n\n\nPotential Source\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCadastral/tax parcel

The requirements imposed by UrbanFootprint on its base conditions data include strict adherence to the data schema, and the need for a detailed understanding of the existing conditions at a parcel level. If you are working in a geographic area that has not had a prior installation of UrbanFootprint, it is unlikely that there will be a dataset that you can use without substantial effort in createing a base condition dataset.  Scenario development has looser data requirements, but will require that you have an understanding of regional and local plans for the future, and have planned out goals for the scenario that can be translated onto a map at a parcel scale.  Environmental constraint layers influence the intensity of development that is possible in locations where these constraints are present.  Reference layers provide a visual reference to UrbanFootprint users while editing or visualizing scenarios.  The transportation module (and any other modules that build on its results) will require that you have substantial additional data derived from both regional transportation infrastructure GIS as well as a travel demand model.  Some of the other analytical modules also require climate data to run.",
