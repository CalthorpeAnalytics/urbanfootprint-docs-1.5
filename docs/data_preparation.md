# Data Preparation

## Goals

* Provide an overview of data needed by UrbanFootprint
* Describe the required fields for base data
* Walk through the steps used for SACOGâ€™s base data preparation.
* Work through an example of preparing data for a county.

## Data Needs

UrbanFootprint is a data intensive application. The effort that goes into data collection, preparation, and review should not be underestimated.

The base data which is also called the base canvas, or existing conditions dataset will require extensive data collection, processing, and then review prior to its use. The requirements imposed by UrbanFootprint on its base conditions data include strict adherence to the data schema, and the need for a detailed understanding of the existing conditions at a parcel level. If you are working in a geographic area that has not had a prior installation of UrbanFootprint, it is unlikely that there will be a dataset that you can use without substantial effort in createing a base condition dataset.

Scenario development has looser data requirements, but will require that you have an understanding of regional and local plans for the future, and have planned out goals for the scenario that can be translated onto a map at a parcel scale.

Environmental constraint layers influence the intensity of development that is possible in locations where these constraints are present.

Reference layers provide a visual reference to UrbanFootprint users while editing or visualizing scenarios.

The transportation module (and any other modules that build on its results) will require that you have substantial additional data derived from both regional transportation infrastructure GIS as well as a travel demand model.

Some of the other analytical modules also require climate data to run.

## Base Data Preparation: SACOG

#### Input Data

* SACOG parcel data
    * SACOG Land Use
    * Dwelling Units
* SACOG TAZ
    * Census 2010 Blockgroups
    * Census 2010 Tracts

### Data Preparation: Topology

* Parcels must not overlap
* Clip the dataset to the county border
* Remove roads and waterbodies

### Dwelling Units

| SACOG Use Code | Dwelling Unit Type |
|----------------|--------------------|
| Rural Residential | Single Family |
| Farm Home | Single Family |
| Very Low Density Res. | Single Family |
| Low Density Res. | Single Family |
| Large Lot Not Farm Home | Single Family |
| Medium Density Res. | Multifamily |
| Medium-High Density Res. | Multifamily |
| High Density Res | Multifamily |
| Urban Residential | Multifamily |

* Total DU = SACOG Parcel DU
* Controlled to TAZ totals
* Assign DU type using crosswalk (right), and assign DU totals to du_detsf
* Du_detsf_sl and du_detsf_ll based on sf/du calculation.
* ACS rates for Attached SF, MF 2-4, and MF 5 plus are applied to all parcels with MF units

### Households

* HH from SACOG 2008
* DU from Parcel Data
* Occupancy rate = HH/DU

### Population

* Calculate Average HH by block group from census data
* Ave. HH size = pop/hh
* Then multiply the HH count in each parcel by the Ave. HH size.

### Employment

* Parcel employment from SACOG 2008
* Crosswalk using the table
* Use LEHD to disaggregate where needed. (next page)
* Accommodation extracted using SACOG Employment Inventory

**Employment Land Use Crosswalk**

Disaggregation
______________

* This technique is used several times during data preparation.
* Calculate the proportion of each SACOG category that goes into each UF Employment Category.
* Use the LEHD 2010 near imputed rate datase as the basis for the disaggregation.

i.e. %emp_entrec = 100*emp_entrec/
(emp_entrec+emp_other_services+emp_accomodation)


Dataset 1 (higher accuracy): 95 employees

Dataset 2: 50 retail, 30 service, and 20 industrial employees.

+---------+------+------+------+------+------+-----+
|Total Emp|Ret. %|Ser. %|Ind. %|# Ret.|# Ser.|# Ind|
+=========+======+======+======+======+======+=====+
|95       |50  |30  |20    |47.5  |28.5  |19   |
+---------+------+------+------+------+------+-----+

### Keep the Goal in Mind

* Data for your region will be unique
* This process should serve as a starting point for developing your data, not a fixed recipe.
